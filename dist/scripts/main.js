"title": "30&quot; Wired Tumbled Amethyst Stone Gun-Metal Black Vintaged Link Chain Necklace",
"description": "This tumbled amethyst stone is 1/2 &quot; wide, about 3/4&quot; tall, and 3/8&quot; thick and wrapped in loops and coils of black plated copper wire.  The bottom of the stone is freckled with imbedded small reddish dots showing its unique character.   The  30&quot; chain and jumpring are gun-metal.\r\n\r\nAmethyst crystals vary in colour from near white to the deepest purple, and may contain shades of pink or red.  Amethyst ’s purple color is a result of the presence of iron ions within the quartz crystals.  These amethyst stones are left in their natural state, tumbled but unpolished and untreated.\r\n\r\nAmethyst is the birthstone for February.\r\n\r\nAmethyst is a stone of the spirit. The purple color of this crystal is the color of the spirit and spirituality. Amethyst is also a crystal of protection, selflessness, nobleness, spiritual consciousness, meditation, balance and inner peace. One very important feature of Amethyst is to serve as a stone of transfiguration and transformation, bringing harmony and peace when needed.\r\n\r\nAccording to a Roman legend, Bacchus, the Roman God of wine, decided to throw the first person that crossed his path to the tigers from his suite. That person was a maiden named Amethyst, who was headed to a temple service for the Moon Goddess Diana. When the tigers jumped at the girl, she called the name of the Goddess, and was instantly transformed into white stone. Bacchus poured some wine over the stone, changing its color to a beautiful purple shade.\r\n\r\nSome believe that Amethyst prevents drunkenness. Legend says that those who drink from a cup made out of Amethyst, or places a small piece of amethyst on their navel, you would be protected from intoxication.\r\n\r\nExcessive exposure to sunlight is not recommended.",

Depending on the destination within the North American continent, the item(s) should arrive in less than 21 days.  If item(s) have not been received within a months time, please contact us. \r\n\r\nWe will do our best to ship our item(s) in the most effective manner.  Even though our items seem &#39;solid&#39;, they are &#39;fragile&#39; in their own way.    We believe that each item should arrive at its destination in the same condition as it leaves our shop.  Most of our items will be shipped as parcels, which is not the least expensive way to ship. Those items that can be safely shipped in envelopes, without risking damage, will be shipped that way.  We ship all of items through Canada Post.\r\n\r\nIn order to keep costs down, we choose to recycle and reuse our shipping packaging where possible.  Only uncompromised recycled packaging material will be reused. \r\n\r\nInsurance and tracking are NOT automatically included on all parcels. If the item(s) shipped are of considerable value, we will consider paying the insurance, if reasonable.    Unless requested or under special circumstances, tracking and insurance can be added at the purchaser&#39;s expense.  All extra shipping costs will be discussed with purchaser prior to shipping.

"description": "This is a handcrafted gun rack made from solid Oak. The rack measures approx 23&quot; wide by 5&quot; tall. It has been stained and varnished to a beautiful finish. The deer feet are fresh from this past hunting season (harvested from the U.P. of Michigan) and have been properly cured. The wall-mounting holes are spaced 16&quot; apart so they can be attached to wall studs. Screws for mounting the rack to the wall are included! Note: this is a stock photo; no two gun racks are exactly alike due to wood grain variation. As with all of my items, I offer Free Shipping!\r\n \r\nTake a look at my other items which include matching antler panels and gun racks!\r\n\r\nPlease email me with any questions or special requests. Note: If you are interested in purchasing just the cured hooves (bent or straight) for your own craft/hobby needs please contact me!\r\n\r\nThanks for looking!\r\n \r\nA unique gift for the hunter in your life!",

It may become dull or dirty but it can easily be washed by gently washing it between your hands with a mild soap.  It will not discolor your skin.\r\n\r\nQ: Is aluminum jewelry heavy?\r\nA: No.  Aluminum is extremely lightweight so is much more comfortable to wear then jewelry made from other metals.\r\n\r\nQ: Can I wear my jewelry while swimming, doing dishes, etc.?\r\nA: Yes, aluminum is great because it will not react to water.\r\n\r\nQ: Will the color coating wear off on the colored pieces?\r\nA: The anodized aluminum coating is fairly hard but it can be scratched by other hard or sharp objects. Also, it will fade if left in direct sunlight for prolonged periods of time.  Therefore, it is best stored by itself in a closed jewelry box.  With proper care you can expect your color jewelry to stay beautiful for at least a few years.\r\n\r\nQ: Is aluminum hypoallergenic?\r\nA: Because aluminum is lead and nickel free, most people will have no reaction when wearing aluminum jewelry.  In fact, I have many customers who can ONLY wear aluminum.  The ear wires are surgical steel which is also hypoallergenic.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks so much for visiting my shop!\r\n",

"title": "South Carolina &quot;No Concealable Weapons Allowed&quot; State Law Approved Size Sticker Decal Door Sign Business Use",
"description": "This 8x12 sign reads &quot;No Concealable Weapons Allowed&quot; and has a gun with a strikethrough.  This sign meets all statutory requirements in The South Carolina Code of Laws Section 23-31-235  for posting at a business to restrict people from carrying concealed weapons into a business.  This sign is an adhesive type and can be adhered to the outside of glass or a flat surface very easily.  It can be mounted to any glass door, window, or entryway to meet the statutory requirements of South Carolina law. \r\n\r\nSouth Carolina Laws are very specific and complex when it comes to putting up signs to prohibit the carrying of guns in your business (size, height, posted at every door).  Most business owners think the signs they have are sufficient but they are not compliant with State laws.  What they don&#39;t know is that some CWP Instructors and people carrying concealed weapons are commonly told in class &quot;if the sign is not the proper size, and in the proper place then ignore it and carry in the business anyway.&quot;  The truth is, they disregard these signs and carry anyway because the law supports them if you don&#39;t post the signs properly! You just won&#39;t know about it until someone is shot in your business, there is an accidental discharge, or you see a gun on someone.  When it comes to bars and restaurants that serve alcohol, it&#39;s not the person carrying the concealed weapon that you necessarily have to worry about... it&#39;s the intoxicated patron that instigates a situation which causes a person carrying to intercede.  Why is this important?  You know in todays society, when something happens SOMEONE is going to sue, and they are not going after the small money. They see your business as &quot;big pocket liability&quot; and if you aren&#39;t compliant with the law it&#39;s easy for them to say your business didn&#39;t take the right steps to help prevent it.  \r\n\r\nSouth Carolina Residents will be charged an 8% Tax",

"title": "Star Wars Biker Scout Blaster",
"description": "The THG Props Biker Scout blaster is the world&#39;s most accurate Biker Scout blaster you can buy. With extreme detail this blaster makes a great addition to your collection as well as trooping. They are Centurion level approved for the Pathfinders detachment of the 501st Legion. They are a great weight for holding for extended troops and look great not only in photos but also in person.\r\n\r\nOur blasters are offered in two different materials, solid resin or our popular &quot;unbreakable&quot; rubber. Both versions come trimmed, sanded, assembled, and painted flat black with no weathering. The hand guard rails are 1/8&quot; Used Future Workshop (lightweight yet strong, and won&#39;t rust), and the scope mount loop is an actual metal scope mount as well.\r\n\r\nOur solid resin version is perfect for careful trooping or display. It is durable enough to take a few knocks, but the smaller sections (such as the tip or end knob) may break if hit at the wrong angle.\r\n\r\nOur &quot;unbreakable&quot; rubber is an in-house polyurethane epoxy rubber that is conventionally indestructible:\r\n- Can withstand up to 5,000 psi.\r\n- Can be bent up to 525% safely.\r\n- Is resistant to moisture, moderate heat, solvents, acid, and intense impact.\r\nIt is perfect for those who like to hand off their blaster to kids for photo ops, and/or for heavy duty trooping.\r\n\r\nDon&#39;t believe the durability of our &quot;unbreakable&quot; version? Check out our material stress test videos if you want to see it for yourself, including what happens when we run a blaster over with our car! These videos were done with our E-11 blaster, which is made from the same material but has more details than the Biker Scout Blaster:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1DX3mHoYVY\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ku1JxDqHuc\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qowURB0AP-I\r\n\r\n*Note* This product contains NO latex.\r\n\r\nModeled by our local Garrison member, TB-22992.\r\nFor more information about Used Future Workshop, please see their FB page here: https://www.facebook.com/UsedFutureWorkshop?ref=hl",

My love of graphics has led me to experiment with many medias and these are a few I&#39;ve chosen for my Etsy shop.  Large vinyl wall decals,  canvas prints and photo stickers.\r\n\r\nI use top quality Oracal matte finish removable vinyl for all my wall graphics that will not harm or leave a residue on your paint surface.  These are recommended for smooth to medium texture walls.  Can not guarantee adhesion to rough or heavily textured wall surfaces.  My canvas prints are done using high quality eco-solvent inks on canvas that&#39;s 50% cotton and 50% poly blend.  These are stretched over pine wood stretcher bars with a 1.5&quot; gallery wrap edge and finished with a protective semi-gloss coating for a long colorful life. Our photo stickers use a white matte weatherproof removable vinyl that are even suitable for outdoor placement.  \r\n\r\nLook around the shop and if you have a phrase, quote or custom graphic you&#39;d like to have made into a vinyl wall sticker, canvas or photo sticker, please contact me to discuss your project.\r\n\r\nThanks You!\r\nZayvee\r\nRed Bird Decals",
